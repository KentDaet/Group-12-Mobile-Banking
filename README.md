# OTP Generation
You must must carry out this operation before you may launch the JK2R mobile banking application. The first step is to enter your active cell number to get your OTP. Simply click "Get OTP" to process the code that will be supplied to you in less than a minute; after waiting a short while for the code to be sent, move on to the next stage.

# OTP Verification
We are now verifying the mobile number you provided to receive the OTP since the OTP code was already sent to it a minute ago. Additionally, this is being done to ensure the user's safety while utilizing the application. The supplied code is already present on the screen, as you can see. Simply copy the code, click "Verify and Sign in," wait a few minutes for verification, and if receiving the OTP code proves challenging, wait at least a minute before trying again.
